class MetagraphMixin(ABC):
    """
    The metagraph class is a core component of the Bittensor network, representing the neural graph that forms the backbone of the decentralized machine learning system.

    The metagraph is a dynamic representation of the network's state, capturing the interconnectedness and attributes of neurons (participants) in the Bittensor ecosystem. This class is not just a static structure but a live reflection of the network, constantly updated and synchronized with the state of the blockchain.

    In Bittensor, neurons are akin to nodes in a distributed system, each contributing computational resources and participating in the network's collective intelligence. The metagraph tracks various attributes of these neurons, such as stake, trust, and consensus, which are crucial for the network's incentive mechanisms and the Yuma Consensus algorithm as outlined in the `NeurIPS paper <https://bittensor.com/pdfs/academia/NeurIPS_DAO_Workshop_2022_3_3.pdf>`_. These attributes
    govern how neurons interact, how they are incentivized, and their roles within the network's
    decision-making processes.

    Args:
        netuid (int): A unique identifier that distinguishes between different instances or versions of the Bittensor network.
        network (str): The name of the network, signifying specific configurations or iterations within the Bittensor ecosystem.
        version (NDArray): The version number of the network, integral for tracking network updates.
        n (NDArray): The total number of neurons in the network, reflecting its size and complexity.
        block (NDArray): The current block number in the blockchain, crucial for synchronizing with the network's latest state.
        stake: Represents the cryptocurrency staked by neurons, impacting their influence and earnings within the network.
        total_stake: The cumulative stake across all neurons.
        ranks: Neuron rankings as per the Yuma Consensus algorithm, influencing their incentive distribution and network authority.
        trust: Scores indicating the reliability of neurons, mainly miners, within the network's operational context.
        consensus: Scores reflecting each neuron's alignment with the network's collective decisions.
        validator_trust: Trust scores for validator neurons, crucial for network security and validation.
        incentive: Rewards allocated to neurons, particularly miners, for their network contributions.
        emission: The rate at which rewards are distributed to neurons.
        dividends: Rewards received primarily by validators as part of the incentive mechanism.
        active: Status indicating whether a neuron is actively participating in the network.
        last_update: Timestamp of the latest update to a neuron's data.
        validator_permit: Indicates if a neuron is authorized to act as a validator.
        weights: Inter-neuronal weights set by each neuron, influencing network dynamics.
        bonds: Represents speculative investments by neurons in others, part of the reward mechanism.
        uids: Unique identifiers for each neuron, essential for network operations.
        axons (List): Details about each neuron's axon, critical for facilitating network communication.

    The metagraph plays a pivotal role in Bittensor's decentralized AI operations, influencing everything from data propagation to reward distribution. It embodies the principles of decentralized governance
    and collaborative intelligence, ensuring that the network remains adaptive, secure, and efficient.

    Example Usage:
        Initializing the metagraph to represent the current state of the Bittensor network::

            metagraph = bt.metagraph(netuid=config.netuid, network=subtensor.network, sync=False)

        Synchronizing the metagraph with the network to reflect the latest state and neuron data::

        Accessing metagraph properties to inform network interactions and decisions::

            total_stake = metagraph.S
            neuron_ranks = metagraph.R
            neuron_incentives = metagraph.I

        Synchronizes the metagraph with the Bittensor network's current state. It updates the metagraph's attributes
        to reflect the latest data from the network, ensuring the metagraph represents the most current state of the network.

        Args:
            block (Optional[int]): A specific block number to synchronize with. If None, the metagraph syncs with the latest block.
                                    This allows for historical analysis or specific state examination of the network.
            lite (bool): If True, a lite version of the metagraph is used for quicker synchronization. This is beneficial
                        when full detail is not necessary, allowing for reduced computational and time overhead.
            subtensor (Optional[bittensor.subtensor]): An instance of the subtensor class from Bittensor, providing an
                                                        interface to the underlying blockchain data. If provided, this
                                                        instance is used for data retrieval during synchronization.

        Returns:
            metagraph: The metagraph instance, updated to the state of the specified block or the latest network state.

        Example:
            Sync the metagraph with the latest block from the subtensor, using the lite version for efficiency::

                metagraph.sync(subtensor=subtensor)

            Sync with a specific block number for detailed analysis::

        NOTE:
            If attempting to access data beyond the previous 300 blocks, you **must** use the ``archive`` network for subtensor.
