            amount: The amount of TAO to stake.
            safe_staking: If true, enables price safety checks to protect against fluctuating prices. The stake will
                only execute if the price change doesn't exceed the rate tolerance.
            allow_partial_stake: If true and safe_staking is enabled, allows partial staking when the full amount would
                exceed the price tolerance. If false, the entire stake fails if it would exceed the tolerance.
            rate_tolerance: The maximum allowed price change ratio when staking. For example, 0.005 = 0.5% maximum price

        Moves stake between subnets while keeping the same coldkey-hotkey pair ownership.
        Like subnet hopping - same owner, same hotkey, just changing which subnet the stake is in.

        Parameters:
            wallet: The wallet to swap stake from.
            hotkey_ss58: The SS58 address of the hotkey whose stake is being swapped.
            origin_netuid: The netuid from which stake is removed.
            destination_netuid: The netuid to which stake is added.
            amount: The amount to swap.
            safe_swapping: If true, enables price safety checks to protect against fluctuating prices. The swap
                will only execute if the price ratio between subnets doesn't exceed the rate tolerance.
            allow_partial_stake: If true and safe_staking is enabled, allows partial stake swaps when the full amount
                would exceed the price tolerance. If false, the entire swap fails if it would exceed the tolerance.
            rate_tolerance: The maximum allowed increase in the price ratio between subnets
                (origin_price/destination_price). For example, 0.005 = 0.5% maximum increase. Only used when
                safe_staking is True.
            period: The number of blocks during which the transaction will remain valid after it's submitted. If the
                transaction is not included in a block within that number of blocks, it will expire and be rejected. You
                can think of it as an expiration date for the transaction.
            raise_error: Raises a relevant exception rather than returning `False` if unsuccessful.
            wait_for_inclusion: Whether to wait for the inclusion of the transaction.
            wait_for_finalization: Whether to wait for the finalization of the transaction.

        Returns:
            ExtrinsicResponse: The result object of the extrinsic execution.

        The price ratio for swap_stake in safe mode is calculated as: origin_subnet_price / destination_subnet_price
        When safe_staking is enabled, the swap will only execute if:

            increasing more than rate_tolerance
