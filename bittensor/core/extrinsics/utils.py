    Submits an extrinsic to the substrate blockchain and handles potential exceptions.

    This function attempts to submit an extrinsic to the substrate blockchain with specified options
    for waiting for inclusion in a block and/or finalization. If an exception occurs during submission,
    it logs the error and re-raises the exception.

    Args:
        subtensor: The Subtensor instance used to interact with the blockchain.
        extrinsic (scalecodec.types.GenericExtrinsic): The extrinsic to be submitted to the blockchain.
        wait_for_inclusion (bool): Whether to wait for the extrinsic to be included in a block.
        wait_for_finalization (bool): Whether to wait for the extrinsic to be finalized on the blockchain.

    Returns:
        response: The response from the substrate after submitting the extrinsic.

    Raises:
        SubstrateRequestException: If the submission of the extrinsic fails, the error is logged and re-raised.
