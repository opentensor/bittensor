    Represents the result of a simulated swap operation.

    This class is used to encapsulate the amounts and fees for the  simulated swap process, including both tao and alpha token values.
    It provides a convenient way to manage and interpret the swap results.

    Attributes:
        tao_amount: The amount of tao tokens obtained as the result of the swap.
        alpha_amount: The amount of alpha tokens obtained as the result of the swap.
        tao_fee: The fee associated with the tao token portion of the swap.

        Converts a dictionary to a SimSwapResult instance.

        This method acts as a factory to create a SimSwapResult object using the data
        from a dictionary. It parses the specified dictionary, converts values into
        Balance objects, and sets associated units based on parameters and context.

        Args:
            data: A dictionary containing the swap result data. It must include  the keys "tao_amount",  "alpha_amount",
                "tao_fee", and "alpha_fee" with their respective values.
            netuid: A network-specific unit identifier used to set the unit for alpha-related amounts.

        Returns:
            SimSwapResult: An instance of SimSwapResult initialized with the parsed  and converted data.
