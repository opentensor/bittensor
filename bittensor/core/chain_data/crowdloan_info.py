    Represents a single on-chain crowdloan campaign from the `pallet-crowdloan`.

    Each instance reflects the current state of a specific crowdloan as stored in chain storage. It includes funding
    details, creator information, contribution totals, and optional call/target data that define what happens upon
    successful finalization.

    Attributes:
        id: The unique identifier (index) of the crowdloan.
        creator: The SS58 address of the creator (campaign initiator).
        deposit: The creator's initial deposit locked to open the crowdloan.
        min_contribution: The minimum contribution amount allowed per participant.
        end: The block number when the campaign ends.
        cap: The maximum amount to be raised (funding cap).
        funds_account: The account ID holding the crowdloanâ€™s funds.
        raised: The total amount raised so far.
        target_address: Optional SS58 address to which funds are transferred upon success.
        call: Optional encoded runtime call (e.g., a `register_leased_network` extrinsic) to execute on finalize.
        finalized: Whether the crowdloan has been finalized on-chain.
        contributors_count: Number of unique contributors currently participating.

    campaigns operate within the Subtensor network.

    Each attribute is fetched directly from the runtime via `Subtensor.substrate.get_constant("Crowdloan", <name>)` and

        MaxContributors: The maximum number of unique contributors allowed per crowdloan.
        MaximumBlockDuration: The maximum allowed duration (in blocks) for a crowdloan campaign.

        MinimumBlockDuration: The minimum allowed duration (in blocks) for a crowdloan campaign.
