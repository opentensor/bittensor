class Axon:
    """
    The ``Axon`` class in Bittensor is a fundamental component that serves as the server-side interface for a neuron within the Bittensor network.

    This class is responsible for managing
    incoming requests from other neurons and implements various mechanisms to ensure efficient
    and secure network interactions.

    An axon relies on a FastAPI router to create endpoints for different message types. These
    endpoints are crucial for handling various request types that a neuron might receive. The
    class is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing users to specify custom rules
    for forwarding, blacklisting, prioritizing, and verifying incoming requests. The class also
    includes internal mechanisms to manage a thread pool, supporting concurrent handling of
    requests with defined priority levels.

    Methods in this class are equipped to deal with incoming requests from various scenarios in the
    network and serve as the server face for a neuron. It accepts multiple arguments, like wallet,
    configuration parameters, ip address, server binding  port, external ip, external port and max
    workers. Key methods involve managing and operating the FastAPI application router, including
    the attachment and operation of endpoints.

    Key Features:

    - FastAPI router integration for endpoint creation and management.
    - Customizable request handling including forwarding, blacklisting, and prioritization.
    - Verification of incoming requests against custom-defined functions.
    - Thread pool management for concurrent request handling.
    - Command-line argument support for user-friendly program interaction.

        Registers an API endpoint to the FastAPI application router.
        It uses the name of the first argument of the :func:`forward_fn` function as the endpoint name.

        The :func:`attach` method in the Bittensor framework's axon class is a crucial function for registering

        and ensuring efficient and secure handling of requests within the Bittensor network.

        Args:
            forward_fn (Callable): Function to be called when the API endpoint is accessed. It should have at least one argument.
            blacklist_fn (Optional[Callable]): Function to filter out undesired requests. It should take the same arguments as :func:`forward_fn` and return a boolean value. Defaults to ``None``, meaning no blacklist filter will be used.
            priority_fn (Optional[Callable]): Function to rank requests based on their priority. It should take the same arguments as :func:`forward_fn` and return a numerical value representing the request's priority. Defaults to ``None``, meaning no priority sorting will be applied.
            verify_fn (Optional[Callable]): Function to verify requests. It should take the same arguments as :func:`forward_fn` and return a boolean value. If ``None``, :func:`self.default_verify` function will be used.

        Note:
            The methods :func:`forward_fn`, :func:`blacklist_fn`, :func:`priority_fn`, and :func:`verify_fn` should be designed to receive the same parameters.

        Raises:

        It asynchronously verifies the integrity of the body of a request by comparing the hash of required fields
        with the corresponding hashes provided in the request headers. This method is critical for ensuring

        """
        This method is used to verify the authenticity of a received message using a digital signature.

        It ensures that the message was not tampered with and was sent by the expected sender.

        The :func:`default_verify` method in the Bittensor framework is a critical security function within the
        Axon server. It is designed to authenticate incoming messages by verifying their digital
        signatures. This verification ensures the integrity of the message and confirms that it was
        indeed sent by the claimed sender. The method plays a pivotal role in maintaining the trustworthiness
        and reliability of the communication within the Bittensor network.

        Key Features
            Security Assurance
                The default_verify method is crucial for ensuring the security of the Bittensor network. By verifying digital signatures, it guards against unauthorized access
                and data manipulation.

            Preventing Replay Attacks
                The method checks for increasing nonce values, which is a vital
                step in preventing replay attacks. A replay attack involves an adversary reusing or
                delaying the transmission of a valid data transmission to deceive the receiver.
                The first time a nonce is seen, it is checked for freshness by ensuring it is
                within an acceptable delta time range.

            Authenticity and Integrity Checks
                By verifying that the message's digital signature matches
                its content, the method ensures the message's authenticity (it comes from the claimed
                sender) and integrity (it hasn't been altered during transmission).

            Trust in Communication
                This method fosters trust in the network communication. Neurons
                (nodes in the Bittensor network) can confidently interact, knowing that the messages they
                receive are genuine and have not been tampered with.

            Cryptographic Techniques
                The method's reliance on asymmetric encryption techniques is a
                cornerstone of modern cryptographic security, ensuring that only entities with the correct
                cryptographic keys can participate in secure communication.

        Args:
            synapse(bittensor.core.synapse.Synapse): bittensor request synapse.

        Raises:
            Exception: If the ``receiver_hotkey`` doesn't match with ``self.receiver_hotkey``.
            Exception: If the nonce is not larger than the previous nonce for the same endpoint key.
            Exception: If the signature verification fails.

        After successful verification, the nonce for the given endpoint key is updated.

        Note:
            The verification process assumes the use of an asymmetric encryption algorithm,
            where the sender signs the message with their private key and the receiver verifies the
            signature using the sender's public key.
