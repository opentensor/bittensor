This repository contains Bittensor's Python API, which can be used for the following purposes:

1. Querying the Bittensor network as a client.
2. Running and building Bittensor miners and validators.
3. Pulling network state information.
4. Managing TAO wallets, balances, transfers, etc.

Bittensor is a mining network, similar to Bitcoin, that includes built-in incentives designed to encourage miners to provide value by hosting trained or training machine learning models. These models can be queried by clients seeking inference over inputs, such as token-based text generations or numerical embeddings from a large foundation model like GPT-NeoX-20B.

Token-based incentives are designed to drive the network's growth and distribute the value generated by the network directly to the individuals producing that value, without intermediaries. The network is open to all participants, and no individual or group has full control over what is learned, who can profit from it, or who can access it.

To learn more about Bittensor, please read our [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VnsobL6lIAAqcA1_Tbm8AYIQscfJV4KU/view).
