# Code Review

### Code Review
Project maintainers reserve the right to weigh the opinions of peer reviewers
using common sense judgement and may also weigh based on merit. Reviewers that
have demonstrated a deeper commitment and understanding of the project over time
or who have clear domain expertise may naturally have more weight, as one would
expect in all walks of life.

Where a patch set affects consensus-critical code, the bar will be much
higher in terms of discussion and peer review requirements, keeping in mind that
mistakes could be very costly to the wider community. This includes refactoring
of consensus-critical code.

Where a patch set proposes to change the Bittensor consensus, it must have been
discussed extensively on the discord server and other channels, be accompanied by a widely
discussed BIP and have a generally widely perceived technical consensus of being
a worthwhile change based on the judgement of the maintainers.

### Finding Reviewers

Add `Cortex` to the reviewers of your PR. If you are unable to add this group (as can happen with
forks), you can directly add the maintainers: [basfroman](https://github.com/basfroman), 
[thewhaleking](https://github.com/thewhaleking), and [ibraheem-abe](https://github.com/ibraheem-abe).

The maintainers generally try to commit at least a small portion of time each day to reviewing community PRs. 
However, in some cases, new PRs can be missed. If your PR has been sitting in an unreviewed status for longer 
than a few business days (Monday - Friday), feel free to tag us on the [Church of Rao](https://discord.gg/brRAeVCmzM) 
[#btcli-btsdk](https://discord.com/channels/1120750674595024897/1242999357436071956) Discord channel.
