    "You can find the model under `~/.bittensor/miners/gpt2-exodus/<wallet-coldkey>-<wallet-hotkey>/model.torch`. This is the default place that miners will store models. Note that the loss stored with the model is the `combined` loss, that is, the local loss + remote network loss + distillation loss. As the Bittensor network grows and more sophisticated models join, this combined loss will come down close to 0 ideally. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, for now, the high loss does not necessarily mean the model will perform badly as a model may have a low local loss but a high remote loss. This happens when the local model is powerful and correctly training, but all the models it is talking to on the network are not so good. This can happen when it's talking to N number of models that are all the same. Since this project is still in the early days, this may happen initially. As the network grows there will be more and more sophisticated "
