    Tests the commit/reveal weights mechanism (CR3)

    Steps:
        1. Register a subnet through Alice
        2. Register Alice's neuron and add stake
        3. Enable commit-reveal mechanism on the subnet
        4. Lower weights rate limit
        5. Change the tempo for subnet 1
        5. Commit weights and ensure they are committed.
        6. Wait interval & reveal weights and verify
    Raises:
        AssertionError: If any of the checks or verifications fail
