    """
    Tests the set/reveal commitments with TLE (time-locked encrypted commitments) mechanism.

    Steps:
        1. Register a subnet through Alice
        2. Register Bob's neuron and add stake
        3. Set commitment from Alice hotkey
        4. Set commitment from Bob hotkey
        5. Wait until commitment is revealed.
        5. Verify commitment is revealed by Alice and Bob and available via mutual call.
        6. Verify commitment is revealed by Alice and Bob and available via separate calls.
    Raises:
        AssertionError: If any of the checks or verifications fail

    Note: Actually we can run this tests in fast block mode. For this we need to set `BLOCK_TIME` to 0.25 and replace
    `False` to `True` in `pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator.
